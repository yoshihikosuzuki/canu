# Canu v2.1.1 + modified haplotype separation for better trio binning

## Modifications and rationale

This repository contains two modifications in the `splitHapplotype` program, which performs haplotype separation of child reads using parent datasets, as follows:

1. Ignore k-mers that appear in the child dataset with a frequency smaller than some threshold (10 by default). This removes potential false positive k-mer matches between child and parent datasets due to sequencing errors (Recall the spike around x=1 in the GenomeScope plot; we discard that part). This value should be determined by looking at the k-mer frequency histogram of the child dataset (using meryl or similar tools).
2. For each child read, Canu by default assigns one of the haplotypes (=parents) that has a larger number of k-mers shared with the child read if the number of k-mers in each of the parent datasets is same. Our modification requires the difference in the number of shared k-mers between the two haplotypes to be greater than some threshold (`-hd` option; 10 by default). A larger threshold makes the decision of haplotype separation more conservative (for example, a read having only 2 mother-mers and 1 father-mer will be classified as ambiguous with the default threshold whereas original Canu regards it as a mother-specific read).

Currently these modifications are not incorporated into the whole pipeline of Canu but into only `splitHaplotype`, and one needs to use a script `run_canu_haplotype.sh` (put in the root directory of this branch) to run it.

## how to install/use

1. Download and compile:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yoshihikosuzuki/canu
cd canu/src
make -j<number of threads>
```

This will generate a directory named `build/` in the root directory of this repository.

2. Modify the script `run_canu_haplotype.sh` (put in the root directory) according to your input files and environments and run it.

# Canu

Canu is a fork of the [Celera Assembler](http://wgs-assembler.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page), designed for high-noise single-molecule sequencing (such as the [PacBio](http://www.pacb.com) [RS II](http://www.pacb.com/products-and-services/pacbio-systems/rsii/)/[Sequel](http://www.pacb.com/products-and-services/pacbio-systems/sequel/) or [Oxford Nanopore](https://www.nanoporetech.com/) [MinION](https://nanoporetech.com/products)).

Canu is a hierarchical assembly pipeline which runs in four steps:

* Detect overlaps in high-noise sequences using [MHAP](https://github.com/marbl/MHAP)
* Generate corrected sequence consensus
* Trim corrected sequences
* Assemble trimmed corrected sequences

## Install:

* The easiest way to get started is to download a binary [release](http://github.com/marbl/canu/releases).

* Installing with a 'package manager' is not encouraged, but if you have no other choice:
  * Conda: `conda install -c conda-forge -c bioconda -c defaults canu`
  * Homebrew: `brew install brewsci/bio/canu`

* Alternatively, you can use the latest unreleased version from the source code.  This version has not undergone the same testing as a release and so may have unknown bugs or issues generating sub-optimal assemblies. We recommend the release version for most users.

        git clone https://github.com/marbl/canu.git
        cd canu/src
        make -j <number of threads>

 * An *unsupported* Docker image made by Frank FÃ¶rster is at https://hub.docker.com/r/greatfireball/canu/.
